## Strategy by Phase

### Early Game (3:00-1:00) - DEFEND
- Tombstone at center to pull/distract
- Valkyrie reactively on swarms
- Mini P.E.K.K.A to kill tanks (Giant, Hog Rider, Knight)
- Goal: survive with both towers

### Double Elixir (1:00-0:00) - ATTACK
- Giant at bridge (columns 1-2, rows A-B)
- Musketeer behind Giant (columns 1-2, rows C-D)
- Archers for extra tower pressure
- Goal: destroy at least one tower

### Overtime - ALL-IN
- Commit everything to Giant + Musketeer push
- Accept tower losses on other side
- Win the king tower race

---

## Card Usage

### Giant (5 elixir) - Win Condition
- **Placement:** Bridge (1-2, A-B) when board is clear
- **Support:** Always have 4+ elixir for Musketeer behind
- **Never:** Play alone without support

### Musketeer (4 elixir) - Key Support
- **Placement:** Behind Giant (1-2, C-D)
- **Also:** Air defense against Minions, Baby Dragon
- **Never:** At the front of a push

### Valkyrie (4 elixir) - Splash Tank
- **Use:** Counter swarms (Skeleton Army, Minions, Goblins)
- **Placement:** Center (2-3, C-D) for max coverage
- **Never:** Single-target defense

### Mini P.E.K.K.A (4 elixir) - Tank Killer
- **Use:** Kill high-HP units (Giant, Hog Rider, Knight, Valkyrie)
- **Placement:** Directly on top of enemy tank, or path intercept
- **Also:** Punish opposite lane when opponent overcommits
- **Never:** Against swarms (gets surrounded and dies)

### Tombstone (3 elixir) - Defense
- **Use:** Pull/distract opponent troops
- **Placement:** Center (2-3, C-D)
- **Effect:** Spawns Skeletons to slow enemies

### Bomber, Minions, Archers (3 elixir each)
- Cheap cycle cards
- Use for supplemental defense or push support
- Don't overcommit - save elixir for Giant

## Key Synergies

- **Giant + Musketeer** = Unstoppable beatdown (MAIN WIN CONDITION)
- **Valkyrie + Bomber** = Perfect swarm clear
- **Mini P.E.K.K.A + Musketeer** = Counter-push after defense
- **Tombstone + Mini P.E.K.K.A** = Tank killing combo (pull + burst)

## Expected Win Rates

| Opponent Rank | Expected Win Rate |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Lower rank | 75%+ |
| Same rank | 55-65% |
| Higher rank | 45-55% |

## Unlocked Cards (Not in Current Deck)

| Card | Elixir | Role | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Cannon | 3 | Defensive building | Ground-targeting defense, pulls units |
| Mega Minion | 3 | Air DPS | Single target, tankier than Minions |
| Barbarians | 5 | Swarm tank killers | 4 melee units, high total DPS |

**Potential Deck Changes:**
- **Mega Minion** could replace Minions for more survivability against spells
- **Cannon** could replace Tombstone for stronger defense against Hog Rider
- **Barbarians** are expensive but devastating against tanks if left alone
