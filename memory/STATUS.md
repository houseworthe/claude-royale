## Session 37 (Dec 8) - IN PROGRESS

**Status:** 0W-1L, -47 trophies (1050→1003)

**Match Results:**
| Match | Opponent | Result | Trophies | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | EvilCoffee | LOSS | 1050→1003 | -47, 0-3 crowns, auto-opener test |

**Analysis:**
- Auto-opener script successfully triggered battle
- Match ended in 0-3 loss (WINNER screen was misleading)
- Agent spawn system encountered permission issues - agents did not spawn
- Battle played without active agents - likely auto-played by system
- Need to investigate agent spawning mechanism

---

## Session 35 (Dec 8) - COMPLETE

**Status:** 0W-1L, -3 trophies (1003→1000)

**Match Results:**
| Match | Opponent | Result | Trophies | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | EvilSaadh | LOSS | 1003→1000 | -3, agents stacked left lane defense |

**Analysis:**
- Agents all reported "WIN" but trophy count showed loss
- Action log showed over-stacking on left lane (multiple agents playing same positions)
- Some vague card plays ("card", "support") suggest card identification issues
- Need better coordination to avoid redundant defensive plays

## System Status

**Three-Agent System:** VALIDATED AND WORKING
- All agents play same match together
- Battle tap + 3 agents spawn in parallel (t=0 simultaneity)
- 60-second polling loop effective
- Auto-opener plays first card within 8 seconds

**Known Issues:**
- Agents occasionally misread result screens (use trophy count to verify)
- Higher-rank opponents require solid fundamentals
