# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Claude Royale!

## Current Status

This is a personal project and **not actively accepting contributions** at this time. The codebase is tightly coupled to my specific setup (BlueStacks window position, screen resolution, etc.) which makes it difficult for others to run or test changes.

## What You Can Do

- **Star the repo** if you find it interesting
- **Open issues** for bugs you notice in the documentation or ideas for improvements
- **Fork it** and build your own version - the architecture is documented in the README

## Future

If the project gains traction and I have time to make it more portable, I may open it up for contributions. The main blockers are:

1. Hardcoded coordinate system needs abstraction
2. No automated testing (it's a visual game)
3. Requires specific hardware/software setup to run

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue with questions about how things work. I'm happy to explain the architecture even if I'm not accepting PRs.
